This repo features a Google Colab [notebook](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tgt9ziNcFsGjoENsY0rsK-qdLBfOrOU2KLGZmawquoc/edit?usp=sharing) and [CSV file.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jLfr2DYkrfI0Sd29_D2yZ5io8T_aHbTa/view?usp=sharing)
The .csv file was created using Xbench and was built from the most current [84,000](https://github.com/84000/data-translation-memory) .tmx translation memory files that were available as of July 2024.  Together, the Colab notebook and .csv file allow the user to reconstruct 84,000 volumes (toh) from the .tmx repos and identify corresponding Tibetan unicode (or English) sentences.
